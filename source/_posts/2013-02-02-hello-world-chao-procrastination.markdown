Hello all.

It has been quite sometime since I entered the amazing world of Web development and the beauty of [Open Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#Computer_software "Open Source Software"). 
I intend to post things here, that will hopefully help some people in some ways. This is going to be an avenue for sharing stuff that I create or think are cool in my areas of interest. A lot of stuff here is going to be highly opinionated.
